# ManaCurve - A _Magic: The Gathering_ Deck Editor

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.3.

## Created by Dan Mace, Eric Conner, Evan Filkins and Josh Gearheart

## Description

This Magic The Gathering deck builder and editor was developed to aid players building specialized card decks. It utilizes a set of filters that return a list of cards and card images from a database that can include all available cards in the Magic: The Gathering universe. It saves built decks in the database. The database can be easily expanded to include future releases of Magic: The Gathering expansion packs.
